#### AI School Africa Capstone Project: Kaggle Spaceship Titanic:
##### Problem Description:

The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner with almost 13,000 passengers on board. The vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.

While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E; the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension. 

The overall goal of this project is to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.
This type of problem would be considered a classification problem because the expected predictions are to be classified as either 'TRUE' (if the passenger was indeed transported to another dimension) or 'FALSE' (if not transported).
